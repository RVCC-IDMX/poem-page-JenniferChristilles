        <div class="one">In winter I get up at night  
            And dress by yellow candle-light.  
            In summer, quite the other way,  
            I have to go to bed by day.
        </div>
        
        <div class="two">
            I have to go to bed and see         
            The birds still hopping on the tree,  
            Or hear the grown-up people's feet  
            Still going past me in the street. 
        </div>

        <div class="three">
            And does it not seem hard to you,  
            When all the sky is clear and blue,  
            And I should like so much to play,  
            To have to go to bed by day?
